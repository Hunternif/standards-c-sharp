# Code quality and standards

https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/

We'll use this repo to discuss and record our decisions for improving and standardizing our code at Agoda.

- What do we have so far? See the [docs](https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/).
- Something bugging you? Create an issue.
- Want to contribute? Send a pull request.
- Want to discuss something in general? See you on #code-quality.

## Process

- All front end devs are invited to attend and participate in our weekly discussions.
- We'll generally tackle one topic each week, for which we'll create a Github issue.
- We discuss the problem in the abstract, and then how to implement propsed solutions in our codebase.
- We add outcomes from the meeting to the Github issue for further discussion and ratification to be performed by the core standardization group.
- Once ratified, the issue becomes an Official Agoda StandardÂ®.
