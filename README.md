## Process

- All front end devs are invited to attend and participate in our weekly discussions.
- We'll generally tackle one topic each week, for which we'll create a Github issue.
- We discuss the problem in the abstract, and then how to implement propsed solutions in our codebase.
- We add outcomes from the meeting to the Github issue for further discussion and ratification to be performed by the core standardization group.
- Once ratified, the issue becomes an Official Agoda StandardÂ®.
