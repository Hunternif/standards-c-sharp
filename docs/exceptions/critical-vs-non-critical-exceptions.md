## Critical vs non-critical exceptions

- **Critical exception**: when this occurs, the page is completely useless to the user. This is like the Google homepage without the serch box.
- **Non-critical exception**: when this occurs, the page can still be used, though with a potentially degraded UX. This is like the Google homepage without the I'm Feeling Lucky button.
