# Unit testing

## Why we test

- To validate that our code does what we think it does.
- To enable us to change existing code with confidence.

## Standards
- [Test method names should clearly indicate what they are testing](test-method-names-should-clearly-indicate-what-they-are-testing.md).
- [Tests should be written as if they are a specification](tests-should-be-written-as-if-they-are-a-specification.md).
- [Tests should be short and simple](tests-should-be-short-and-simple.md)
- [Use test cases appropriately](use-test-cases-appropriately.md)
- [Use test cases to test boundary conditions](use-test-cases-to-test-boundary-conditions.md)
- [Keep functions pure if possible](keep-functions-pure-if-possible.md)
- [Be wary of refactoring tests](be-wary-of-refactoring-tests.md)
- [Prefer black box over white box testing](prefer-black-box-over-white-box-testing.md)
- [Only test the public interface](only-test-the-public-interface.md)
- [Create reusable concrete mocks](create-reusable-concrete-mocks.md)
- [Consider using AutoFixture](consider-using-autofixture.md)
