## Immutable collections

We have yet to come up with a use-case for .NET's immutable collections at Agoda.

If you are using an immutable, there is a fair chance you are doing it wrong, and a Synchronized collection might be more appropriate for thread-safe access.

But please feel free to contribute any valid use cases you may find so we can update these docs.
